6. His college training made him a teacher.
7. I don't find the drug bitter.

9. He found the trip exciting.

#### B. Complement
##### a. 英语中Be动词在句子中不能省略, 但翻译成中文，如果补语是形容词，“是”会被丢弃
  1. Taroko Gorge is beautiful. Taroko Gorge ~~is(是)~~ 美丽的
  2. The soup is too hot. 汤 ~~is(是)~~ 太烫了

##### b. 除了Be, 还有哪些**Linking Verb**

| 是 | Example | 为(是的文言文) | Example |
| -- | -- | --| -- |
| look | That dress looks pretty. | turn(转变为) ||
| seem(似乎是) | The dog seems friendly. | prove(证实为) | The story proved false. |
| appear(显得是) | His demands appear reasonable. | become(成为) | He became a teacher. |
| sound | His trip sounds exciting. | make(作为) | A nurse make a good wife. |
| feel | I feel sick. |||
| taste | The drug tastes bitter. |||

##### c. 这类动词**Linking Verb**本身没有叙述能力, 需要用Complement补足句子, 补语有两种词类
  1. 名词(noun) - 表达与主语的同等关系
  2. 形容词(adjective)

##### d. Be不作为**Linking Verb**, 不解释为"是, 而是要解释为"存在", 用在S+V句型中
  1. I think, therefore I am. (René Descartes, 笛卡儿)
  2. To be or not to be, that is the question. (@Hamlet, 哈姆雷特)

## IV. 动词的<span style="color:red">"时(time)"</span>和<span style="color:yellow">"态(aspect)"</span>

![](Verb Time and Aspect/Canvas 1.png)

#### A. 以简驭繁的方式:
* **Time(Past/Present/Future)**和**Aspect**分开处理
* 当需要表达进行或被动语态时, 把Be动词当作动词, 句子**只有两种Aspect状态(简单态与完成态)**, 其后的现代分词(Ving)和过去分词(Ven)视为**形容词补语**, Ving表示Continuous, Ven表示Passive Voice

#### B. 使役动词和动词原型
1. The teacher **made** the little girl **stay** behind. <span style="color:red">let/have/make等使役动词, 后面是接原型动词, 是因为它的结果不具有不确定性, 因而不能用不定式</span>
2. The teacher **asked** the little girl **to stay** behind.
3. John **had** his car **painted** over. <span style="color:red">并不是使役动词后面只能用原型</span>

#### C. 感官动词和动词原型
1. I **heard** her **playing**the violin. <span style="color:red">感官动词see/hear/watch, 只能配合确实发生过的事情, 可以和现在分词一起使用.</span>
2. I **heard **her **cry** out in pain. <span style="color:red">大叫一声, 叫声并不能持续, 所以不能用现在分词. 既不能用不定式, 也没有被动的语态, 所以只好用动词原型了</span>

#### D. 动名词

## VI. 虚拟语气(Moods)

#### A. 叙述事实的语气(Indicative)
##### a. 现在和过去的事情, 真假已经可以确定, 所以用叙述事实的语气. 未来的事情还没有发生, 严格说来还不能确定真假, 这就是为啥未来式要在动词前加上助动词will, 因为助动词都带有不确定性.
1. He went to the U.S. last year.
2. I will go to the U.S. next year to study for an MBA degree.

##### b. 可以用公式计算出来, 可以当作事实来叙述
1. The weatherman says sunrise tomorrow is at 5:32.
2. The movie starts in 5 minutes. 同上

##### c. 主从句同时叙述两件未来的事情, 需要先假定其中一件是事实, 才能推论另外一件. 所以从句用现在式
1. I'll be ready when he comes.
2. If you are late again, you will be fired.

#### B. 条件语气(Conditional)
##### a. 句子中加上助动词, 产生不确定的语气, 称为条件语气
1. You are right. → You may be right.
2. The doctor thinks it can be AIDS. → It could be anything - AIDS or a common cold.

##### b. 用完成式表达对过去的猜测
```
must → should
will → would
can → could
may → might
并不代表时间上的变化, 而是表示更不确定的语气, 要用一种特别的方式来表达过去时间
```
1. It may rain any minute now. → It may have rained a little last night.

#### C. 假设语气(Subjunctive)
|Time|从句|主语|
|-|-|
||要把假设条件当真, 所以不能用表示不确定性的助动词|在一个假定条件下"就会/就可能"有啥结果, 所以用过去拼法的助动词|
|<span style="color:yellow">现在时间</span>|<span style="color:yellow">现在式 → 过去式</span>|<span style="color:yellow">过去拼法的助动词 + V(动词原型)</span>|
||If I were you|I wouldn't do it|
||If I were to take the bribe|I could never look at other people in the eye again|
|<span style="color:yellow">过去时间</span>|<span style="color:yellow">过去式 → 过去完成式</span>|<span style="color:yellow">过去拼法的助动词 + have + Ven(完成)</span>|
||If I had known earlier|I might have done something|
|未来时间|过去拼法的助动词 + V(动词原型)|过去拼法的助动词 + V(动词原型)|
|未来时间接近条件语气, 表示不确定的语气|If an asteroid should hit the earth|man could die out|
||If I should take the money| could you guarantee secrecy|
|<span style="color:blue">过去 + 现在</span>|If I **had studied** harder in school|I **could qualify** for the job **now**|
|<span style="color:blue">混合真假</span>|If I had have any money with me(**false**) → only that I didn't have any money with me(**true**)|I could have contributed to the fund drive then|
|<span style="color:Fuchsia">句型变换</span>|It's time **you kid were in bed**||
||**If only I had more time!**||
||**I wish I had more time!**||

#### D. 祈使语气(Imperative)

## VII. 从句的简化(Reduced Clauses)
#### A. 通用规则
##### a. 省略从句中的主语和Be动词, 只留补语
1. Whether ~~it is~~ insured or not(副词从句), your house, ~~which is~~ a wooden building(形容词从句), needs a fire alarm. → Whether insured or not, your house, a wooden building, needs a fire alarm.
2. It is common courtesy ~~that one should( → is~~ to~~)~~ wear black(名词从句) while ~~one attends( → is~~ attending~~)~~ a funeral(副词从句). → It is common courtesy to wear black while attending a funeral.

##### b. 没有Be动词如何处理
1. 有助动词 → 不定式
  * He studied hard so that he could get a scholarship. →
    * He studied hard ~~so that he was (able)~~ to get a scholarship. →
    * He studied hard to get scholarship.
  * 省略后意思如果不清楚可以如此补充
  He studied hard **so as** to get scholarship./He studied hard **in order** to get a scholarship.
2. 没有助动词 → Ving
  * John remembers that he saw the lady before. →
    * John remembers seeing the lady before.

#### B. 形容词从句(关系从句)的简化
##### a. 补语为Ven
1. Beer **which is chilled to 6 ℃** is most delicious. → Beer **chilled to 6 ℃** is most delicious.
2. Your brother John, **who was wounded in war**, will soon be sent home. → Your brother, **wounded in war**, will soon be sent home.

##### b. 补语为Ving
1. The ship **which is coming to shore** is from Gaoxiong. → The ship **coming to shore** is from Gaoxiong.
2. My old car, **which break down every other week**, won't last much longer. → My old car, **breaking down every other week**, won't last much longer.
