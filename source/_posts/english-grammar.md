9. He found the trip exciting.

#### B. Complement
##### a. 英语中Be动词在句子中不能省略, 但翻译成中文，如果补语是形容词，“是”会被丢弃
  1. Taroko Gorge is beautiful. Taroko Gorge ~~is(是)~~ 美丽的
  2. The soup is too hot. 汤 ~~is(是)~~ 太烫了

##### b. 除了Be, 还有哪些**Linking Verb**

| 是 | Example | 为(是的文言文) | Example |
| -- | -- | --| -- |
| look | That dress looks pretty. | turn(转变为) ||
| seem(似乎是) | The dog seems friendly. | prove(证实为) | The story proved false. |
| appear(显得是) | His demands appear reasonable. | become(成为) | He became a teacher. |
| sound | His trip sounds exciting. | make(作为) | A nurse make a good wife. |
| feel | I feel sick. |||
| taste | The drug tastes bitter. |||

##### c. 这类动词**Linking Verb**本身没有叙述能力, 需要用Complement补足句子, 补语有两种词类
  1. 名词(noun) - 表达与主语的同等关系
  2. 形容词(adjective)

##### d. Be不作为**Linking Verb**, 不解释为"是, 而是要解释为"存在", 用在S+V句型中
  1. I think, therefore I am. (René Descartes, 笛卡儿)
  2. To be or not to be, that is the question. (@Hamlet, 哈姆雷特)
