What’s it like to ride in a self-driving car?
乘坐无人驾驶车是一种什么感觉？
It’s thrilling for a minute or two, and then boring. Which is a good thing
头两分钟是兴奋, 然后就感到的是无聊. 这应该是一个好事.

Where we’re going, we don’t need steering wheels ![]()

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are one of the most talked-about technologies ** of the moment **.
无人驾驶机动车是目前谈论的最多(最热门)的话题之一.  
** And little wonder: **
并不奇怪 
they promise to revolutionise the transport of people, and physical goods, just as dramatically as the internet transformed the delivery of information. But they raise many questions.
AVs承诺给人员和货物的运输来来革命性的巨变, 就像Internet改变了信息的传播方式. 但是它们也引发了很多疑问.
When will they be available? Will they be safe? Will they make car-ownership obsolete? And most of all: what is it like to ride in a car that drives itself?
AVs啥时候Ready? 它们安全吗? 它们会使"拥有车辆权"过时吗? 最重要的是: 乘坐在一辆自动驾驶的车里是一种怎样的体验?


I’ve spent the past few months working on a 10,000-word special report on AVs for The Economist, which was published in this week’s issue.
我已经花了几个月的时间为"经济学人"准备一份关于AVs的特别报告, 这份报告会再本周发表
The focus of my report is mostly on the long-term implications of AVs, based on the assumption (a reasonable one, I think) that the technology can be made to work reliably in the next few years.
我报告的主要关注点在于AVs的长期的影响, 这个是基于技术会在今后的几年内变得可靠稳定的假设(这是一个合理的假设)
Rather than focusing on the minutiae of things like the ever-changing industry alliances, or who is suing who, I concentrated instead on the impact on urban planning, the transformation of retailing and the broader social and political implications of cars that can drive themselves.
预期去注意不断变化的行业联盟, 或者谁起诉了谁, 这类细枝末节的事情, 我更加关注对城市规划的影响, 对零售业的改变, 自动驾驶车辆对更广泛的社会和政治的影响
I spoke to as many urban planners and social historians as machine-learning experts or car-industry executives. 
我和很多城市规划者, 社会历史学家, 也包括机器学习专家, 汽车行业的高管交谈过. 
All this ** horizon-scanning and future-gazing ** was fun. But to kick off the report, I had to actually go in a self-driving car. 
所有这些对未来的展望都很有趣. 但是抛开这份报告, 我很有必要实际坐进一辆自动驾驶的车里. 
Which is how I found myself, on a snowy morning a few weeks ago, standing in a car park in Pittsburgh, waiting for an automated ride.
这就是为啥, 在前几周的一个下雪的早上, 我发现自己站在Pittsburgh的一个停车场, 等待一次自动驾驶的体验.

Three years ago I went in a self-driving car in Shanghai. 
三年前我在上海尝试过一辆自动驾驶汽车.
It was quite a basic example: what is known in the field as a “Level 2” vehicle. 
那是一辆最基本的样车: 在这个领域内作为"Level 2"的车辆.
This means it can steer itself, and maintain a safe distance from the car in front, while driving in highway traffic. 
这意味着它可以在高速公路上自动驾驶, 保持于前方这辆的安全距离.
I rode in an Audi A7, and a few cars now on the market (notably those made by Tesla) are capable of Level 2 automation.
我乘坐在一辆Audi A7, 现在市场上达到Level 2的车辆有一些了(尤其是Tesla生产的)
But the driver is required to keep hands on or near the wheel, and to pay attention to the surroundings, in case anything unexpected happens.
但是驾驶员需要把手放在方向盘上或靠近方向盘, 并且注意周围的环境, 应对任何不可预期的事情发生.
With the next level up, Level 3, the car takes more responsibility for monitoring its surroundings, allowing the driver to relax a bit more. 
再上一个级别的, 就是Level 3的车辆在监控它周围环境时承担更多的责任, 让驾驶员更加的轻松.
But if the car encounters a situation it cannot deal with, it sounds a warning telling the driver to resume control. The first Level 3 vehicle, the Audi A8, goes on sale this year.
但是如果车辆遇到它不能处理的情况, 它会发出警告的声音提醒驾驶员恢复控制. 第一辆Level 3的车辆, Audi A8, 今年会开卖

Level 2 and Level 3 are really just glorified forms of cruise control.
Level 2和Level 3确实只是定速巡航的增强形式
A truly self-driving vehicle doesn’t just follow the road ahead of it. 
一个真正的自动驾驶汽车不是沿着路朝前开而已.
It does route-planning and knows where it’s going. 
它会做路线规划, 并且知道它打算去哪里.
It handles junctions, crossings, traffic lights and road signs, and interacts smoothly with other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. 
它会处理车辆汇入点, 十字路口, 交通信号灯和路面的标志, 并且和其他车辆, 行人和自行车平稳的互动.
This is, to say the least, a big leap. 
这个至少才可以说是一个巨大的飞跃.
A Level 4 vehicle is defined as one that can do all of this, without any input from a human driver, within a limited area: in practice, a city neighbourhood that has been mapped in very fine detail, to give the car a big head start in understanding its surroundings.
在一个有限的区域内, 一辆Level 4的自动驾驶车辆就是被定义为可以在没有任何人类驾驶员输入的条件下完成上述所有目标的车辆. 这个有限的区域实际上已经被精细的绘制出来, 让我们的自动驾驶车辆在理解它的周围环境中有一个很好的开端.
A Level 5 vehicle (something that does not yet exist) is one that can in theory drive anywhere, like a human driver.
一辆Level 5的自动驾驶车辆(目前还不存在)就是那种理论上可以在任何地方自动驾驶的车辆, 就像人类驾驶员一样.
That may be an unattainable goal: some people dislike driving at night, or in snow, and I would not volunteer to drive a car in Delhi unless I really had to. 
这也许是一个无法达成的目标: 有些人不喜欢在夜间开车, 或下雪的时候开车, 同样我也不愿意在"Delhi"自愿开车, 除非迫不得已.
The upshot is that the most advanced AVs on the roads today are generally Level 4 vehicles that operate within specific regions of particular cities.
结果就是目前路上最先进的AVs只是一般意义上的第4代自动驾驶车辆, 只能在特定的城市的指定区域驾驶.

Different cities offer different testing environments. 
不同的城市提供不同的测试环境.
Phoenix, Arizona is popular because it has a regular grid system and reliably good weather (snow can confuse the LIDAR sensors that AVs use to scan their surroundings). 
"Phoenix, Arizona"比较受欢迎是因为它有着规则的网格线路和可靠的好天气(大雪可以让AVs的扫描他们周围环境的LIDAR传感器失灵).
AVs can also be seen on the roads in and around Mountain View, for similar reasons, and because so many technology firms are based in the Bay Area. 
因为同样的理由, 也可以在"Mountain View"的路上看到AVs, 并且也是因为太多的技术公司都在湾区.
The early history of self-driving vehicles was shaped by the rivalry between Stanford University in California and Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which have produced many of the engineers now leading AV projects around the world. 
自动驾驶的早起历史是由于加州的斯坦福大学和匹兹堡的卡内基梅隆大学竞争而形成的, 这给现在的世界输出了大量的工程师来引领自动驾驶的项目.
This has made Pittsburgh another hub of AV research and testing. 
这点也让"Pittsburgh"成为另外一个自动驾驶的研究和测试中心.
The city is considered a more challenging environment than Phoenix, because its road layout is more complex, and the weather is worse. 
这座城市被认为比"Phoenix"更具有挑战的环境, 因为它的马路布局更加复杂, 并且天气情况也更加恶劣.
San Francisco’s urban environment is particularly complex, which is why Kyle Vogt, the boss of Cruise, an AV startup acquired by General Motors, says it is the best place for testing (check out his blog post for some very impressive video footage). 
旧金山的市区的环境也是特别复杂, 直就是为啥"Kyle Vogt"一个被通用汽车收购的自动驾驶创业公司(Cruise的老板), 认为它是最佳的测试地点(你可以在他的博客上找到很多印象深刻的视频短片).
If you can make it there, you might say, you can make it anywhere.
如果你在旧金山可以搞定, 你可以说你可以在人和地方搞定自动驾驶.


A self-driving Uber vehicle. That round thing on the top is the LIDAR sensor. ![]()

Anyway, back to Pittsburgh. 
不管怎么说, 先回到"Pittsburgh".
Uber has hired a lot of engineers from Carnegie Mellon, and Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group, which is developing its self-driving cars, is based in the city. 
Uber已经从卡内基梅隆雇佣了大量的工程师, Uber开发它自有的自动驾驶车辆的先进技术团队也坐落在"Pittsburgh".
The vehicle I climbed into was a modified Volvo XC90, with a bundle of extra sensors, including cameras and a spinning LIDAR unit, on its roof. 
我爬进去的是一辆根据Volvo XC90改造的车辆, 车顶上带着一堆外置的传感器, 包括摄像头和可以转动的LIDAR单元.
Ryan, the vehicle’s safety driver, manually drove the vehicle out of the car park and onto the public roads, before pressing a button to engage the self-driving system. And then the car started driving itself.
Ryan, 这辆车的安全驾驶员, 在按下一个按钮启动自动驾驶系统之前, 他是手动驾驶这辆车从停车场开出来, 开到公共到路上的. 然后这辆车才开始靠它自己驾驶. 

At first, the experience is thrilling. 
起初的体验是很激动人心的.
It seems like magic when the steering wheel turns by itself, or the car gently slows to a halt at a traffic light. 
当驾驶方向盘自己转动的时候, 或者在交通信号灯前这辆车渐渐的减速, 使它看上去像魔法.
The autonomous Uber drove carefully but confidently in downtown traffic and light snow, slowing down when passing a school or approaching the brow of a hill, and putting its foot down (as it were) when faced with an open, straight road with no other traffic. 
这个自动驾驶的Uber在市中心和小雪的情况下小心并自信的驾驶着, 当通过学校或接近山顶的时候降低自己的速度, 并且会在面对开阔的, 没有其他车辆的直行道路上, 踩下油门(就好像).
The most noticeable difference from a human driver was that the vehicle made no attempt to avoid Pittsburgh’s notorious potholes, making the ride slightly bumpy at times. 
和人类驾驶者相比较最大的区别就是这辆车没有试图躲避"Pittsburgh"名声狼藉的坑坑洼洼, 整个驾驶过程有些轻微的颠簸.
Sitting in the back seat, I could see a digital representation, displayed on an iPad mounted between the front seats, of how the car perceived the world, with other vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists highlighted in clusters of blue dots. 
坐在后排, 我可以看见一个数字仪表盘, 显示在一个安装在前排座椅中的的iPad上, 用高亮的一组蓝点标记其他车辆, 行人和自行车, 展现它是如何观察这个世界的.
I felt as though I was living in the future. But then, after a minute or two, the novelty wore off. When technology works as expected, it’s boring.
我感觉自己就像生活在未来世界. 但是过了几分钟, 新奇感消失了, 技术如预期的工作, 他是显得和枯燥了.

How the car sees the world. Objects of particular interest are shown in blue. ![]()

This is, in fact, exactly the reaction that engineers are hoping for. 
事实上, 这是工程师们确实期待的反馈.
Noah Zych, Uber’s head of system safety for autonomous cars, told me that after working on AVs for ten years, he was finally able to offer his parents a ride in a self-driving car last year when they came to visit. 
Noah Zych, Uber自动驾驶系统安全部门的头, 他告诉我在AVs领域工作了十年后, 他终于可以给来参观的父母提供一次自动驾驶的乘坐体验.
After their ride ended, he asked them what they thought of it. “And my mom said, ‘actually, it was kind of boring’. And that’s the response that we really want,” he says.
试乘体验之后, 他问他们的感受. "然后我母亲说, '事实上有些无聊', 这就是我们想要的反馈," 他说到.
Uber has offered some riders in Pittsburgh and Phoenix the option to travel in its self-driving vehicles, provided the start and end points of their ride fall within their area of operation. (Riders can say no if they want to.) 
Uber已经为在"Pittsburgh"和"Phoenix"的一些车手提供自动驾驶车辆的选择, 只要他们提供的驾驶的起始点和终点落在他们可以操作的区域内. (驾驶者可以说不, 如果他们想这样的话).
Around 50,000 people have travelled in Uber’s self-driving cars in the past couple of years. 
在过去的几年里, 大概有50,000左右的人已经参与了Uber的自动驾驶体验.
Uber wants to understand how to design the in-car experience (such as what information should be shown on the screen), and it also wants to reassure both riders and other road-users about the safety of autonomous vehicles.
Uber想知道如何设计车内的体验(例如怎样的信息应该被展示到屏幕上), 并且它也想让乘客和路人对自动驾驶的车辆的安全感到放心. 
“The best way to convince people that a self-driving vehicle is going to be safe and capable of driving them around in the future is to give them that first experience,” says Mr Zych.
Mr Zych说, "最好的方式劝说人们自动驾驶的车辆在未来会变得越来越安全就是给他们提供一手的体验".

Ryan, the safety driver in my self-driving Uber, had to take over occasionally, for example to steer the car around a delivery truck that had blocked the road — the car was programmed to play things safe and wait, rather than cross the double-yellow lines in the middle of the road — and to guide the car through roadworks where the lane markings had been recently changed. 
Ryan, 在我的自动驾驶车里的安全司机, 有时候不得不主动接管车辆, 举例来说, 驾驶车辆绕开挡住马路的的一辆卸货卡车 - 这辆自动驾驶的车辆被设定保持安全的等待状态, 而不是穿过马路中间的双黄线 - 并通过最近改变车道标线的道路工程引导车辆。
A couple of times he also took over when the car looked as though it might be passing a bit too close to another vehicle. 
有几次当这辆车子看上去好像和其他车辆过于接近的时候, 他也接管了驾驶.
In each case a collision was unlikely, Ryan explained, but if people think a collision is imminent, they will not feel safe. 
Ryan解释到, 每一种要碰撞的情况其实是不会发生的, 但是如果人们认为碰撞将要发生, 他们会感到不安全.
So part of his job is to flag up instances where the car’s driving style could be tweaked to provide a better experience for passengers. 
所以他的部分工作就是在这辆车的驾驶风格中可以微调的地方标记这些实例, 给乘客提供更好的体验.
At the end of each day, the contents of the car’s on-board computers are downloaded for analysis. 
每天工作结束前, 这辆车子的车载电脑上的内容会被下载下来用以分析.
Each time the safety driver had to take over — an event known as a “disengagement” — the corresponding data can be analysed to see how the car’s software could be improved. 
每次安全司机不得不接入的情况被认定为一次"脱靶" - 对应的数据可以被分析用来如何改进这辆车的软件.
It is then possible to simulate how the car would have responded with various modifications to its algorithms. 
这样可以让模拟如何让车辆通过对他的算法的改变来做出不同的响应成为可能.
“We can play it back again and again, vary the scenario and see the distribution of outcomes,” says Mr Zych.
我们可以一次又一次地回放，改变场景并查看结果的分布
After being tested in simulation, the improved software is then rolled out in real vehicles. 
在模拟环境中测试之后, 改进的软件会再真实的车辆中更新.
It is first tested on a small subset of routes, called “canonical” routes, which test different aspects of its behaviour. If it works as expected, the software is then rolled out for general use.
首次测试会再线路的很小的子集中进行, 称之为"标准的"线路, 用来测试软件的行为的不同方面. 如果它如预期的工作, 软件会正式升级.

I spent most of my hour in a self-driving Uber discussing disengagements, algorithm design and user interfaces, which (to me, at least) are just as exciting as being in a futuristic robocar. 
我在这辆自动驾驶的Uber上花了大量的时间讨论"脱靶", 算法涉及和用户界面, 这些对于我来说和未来的robocar一样激动人心.
And even when the driving algorithms are working perfectly, there are several practical questions that still have to be addressed. 
然而即使当驾驶算法可以完美的工作, 这里仍然有一些实际的问题需要被解决.
For example, how will people actually hail driverless vehicles? 
举例来说, 将来人们如何和无人驾驶车辆打招呼?
They can’t just stop anywhere, or they will block traffic and annoy people. 
它们不可以随便停车, 否则它们会阻塞交通并且干扰人们(的正常活动).
Human drivers can pick a good place to stop, but machines will need help. 
人类的司机可以选择一个最佳的地方停车, 但是机器仍然需要帮助.
Uber has already started identifying good pick-up and drop-off points in some cities, and suggesting them to riders of human-driven vehicles. 
Uber已经开始在某些城市识别定位理想的上客和下客的位置, 并且建议他们乘坐人类驾车辆
But it may be that in future, streets will have designated pick-up and drop-off areas; 
但是或许不就得将来, 街道重新设计上客和下客的区域.
already, some university campuses and apartment blocks are being built with ride-hailing in mind. 
已经有一些大学校园和公寓大楼正在建设中(with ride-hailing in mind).
And how will a self-driving vehicle be able to tell that everyone is on board and ready to go? Some kind of “start” button will be needed — and a “stop” button, too, in case a rider suddenly wants to get out of the vehicle. (The driverless Uber has a “pull over” button for this.)
自动驾驶车辆如何能够告诉车上的乘客准备粗发? 某种类型的"开始"按钮还是需要的 - 还有"停止"按钮也是需要的, 当乘客忽然想下车的时候.(无人驾驶的Uber有一个"靠边停车的"按钮来对应这种情况)

Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google’s parent company, hopes to launch a robotaxi service in Phoenix later this year. 
在今后的几年里, Waymo, Google母公司的自动驾驶部门, 打算提供自动驾驶的出租车服务在凤凰城.
Waymo has the lowest disengagement rate in the industry, and is generally considered the leader in the field; 
在业界, Waymo的"脱靶"率是最低的, 并且被公认为这个领域内的领导者;
its autonomous vehicles can now operate in Phoenix without the need for safety drivers. 
它的的自动驾驶车辆可以在"Phoenix", 在没有安全司机协助的情况下完成驾驶.
GM’s Cruise, which is fast catching up with Waymo, hopes to launch a robotaxi service in 2019, using autonomous Chevy Bolts that do not have a steering wheel, pedals or any other kind of manual controls. 
通用汽车的Cruise, 是最接近余Waymo技术的, 他们希望提供无人驾驶的出租车服务在2019年, 使用自动驾驶的Chevy Bolt, 这种车没有方向盘, 踏板和其他各种手动控制的东西.
So they, too, will have to be able to operate entirely autonomously without a safety driver. 
所以它们将不得不在没有安全司机的情况下完全自动驾驶.
Dozens of other firms are also working on self-driving vehicles. 
一堆其他的公司都正在研发自动驾驶的车辆.
Over the coming months and years more AVs will take to the roads in more cities, and the areas in which they operate will gradually expand. 
在今后的几个月里和几年内, 更多的AVs将会在更多的城市里上路, 并且它们的行驶范围会更加广阔.
Probably sometime in the 2020s, you will take your first ride in a self-driving car. 
有可能在2020年, 你可以在自动驾驶的车辆里进行你的首次乘坐.
It will be exciting at first — but then, if all goes well, it should quickly become reassuringly boring.
它首先将会是兴奋的, 然后, 如果它运行正常, 它会变得让人踏实的无聊.
