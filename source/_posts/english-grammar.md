## <a name="sentences-complements">II. Sentences & Complements</a>
#### A. Five different verbs correspond to five basic sentence patterns(五种不同特性的动词对应五种基本句型)
{% asset_img sentence_pattern.png %}
##### a. S+V(Intransitive Verb)
1. John Smith died in World War Two.

##### b. S+V(Transitive Verb)+O
1. John Smith killed three enemy soldiers.

##### c. S+V(Transitive Verb)+O+O
1. <span style="color:yellow">John‘s father gave him a dog.</span>

##### d. S+V(Linking Verb)+C
1. The soup is too hot.
2. John Smith was a soldier.
3. John Smith was courageous.
4. <span style="color:blue">I feel sick.</span>

##### e. S+V(Linking Verb(连缀动词))+O+C
1. <span style="color:blue">The food made me sick.</span>
2. Most people consider a nurse a good wife.
3. I find the dress pretty.
4. The meat made the dog friendly.
5. <span style="color:yellow">John's father called him a dog.</span>
6. His college training made him a teacher.
7. I don't find the drug bitter.
8. I consider the story false.
9. He found the trip exciting.

#### B. What are Linking Verbs Followed by Complements or Objects + Complements
In English, linking verbs can not be omitted. But when we translate them into Chinese, and also if the complements are adjectives, “是” will be omitted.(英语中Be动词在句子中不能省略, 但翻译成中文，如果补语是形容词，“是”会被丢弃)
1. Taroko Gorge is beautiful. Taroko Gorge ~~_是_~~ 美丽的
2. The soup is too hot. 汤 ~~_是_~~ 太烫了

In addition to 'Be', What else are Linking Verbs.(除了Be, 还有哪些Linking Verb)

| 是 | Example | 为(是的文言文) | Example |
| - | - | - | - |
| look | That dress looks pretty. | turn(转变为) | |
| seem(似乎是) | The dog seems friendly. | prove(证实为) | The story proved false. |
| appear(显得是) | His demands appear reasonable. | become(成为) | He became a teacher. |
| sound | His trip sounds exciting. | make(作为) | A nurse make a good wife. |
| feel | I feel sick. | | |
| taste | The drug tastes bitter. | | |

Because these linking Verbs themselves have no abilities to describe something detail, so we must use complements to make sentences completed. There are two types of words can be complements.(Linking Verb本身没有叙述能力, 需要用Complement补足句子, 补语有两种词类)
1. noun - the same relationship with the subject (表达与主语的同等关系)
2. adjective

#### C. When "Be" is not a Linking Verb (Be不作为**Linking Verb**, 不解释为"是, 而是要解释为"存在", 用在S+V句型中)
1. I think, therefore I am. (René Descartes, 笛卡儿)
2. To be or not to be, that is the question. (@Hamlet, 哈姆雷特)

## <a name="verb-tenses">IV. Verb Tenses</a>
{% asset_img verb_time_aspect_1.png %}

#### B. 使役动词和动词原型
1. The teacher **made** the little girl **stay** behind. <span style="color:red">let/have/make等使役动词, 后面是接原型动词, 是因为它的结果不具有不确定性, 因而不能用不定式</span>
2. The teacher **asked** the little girl **to stay** behind.
3. John **had** his car **painted** over. <span style="color:red">并不是使役动词后面只能用原型</span>

#### C. 感官动词和动词原型
1. I **heard** her **playing**the violin. <span style="color:red">感官动词see/hear/watch, 只能配合确实发生过的事情, 可以和现在分词一起使用.</span>
2. I **heard **her **cry** out in pain. <span style="color:red">大叫一声, 叫声并不能持续, 所以不能用现在分词. 既不能用不定式, 也没有被动的语态, 所以只好用动词原型了</span>

#### D. 动名词

## <a name="moods">VI. Moods</a>
#### A. 叙述事实的语气(Indicative)
##### a. 现在和过去的事情, 真假已经可以确定, 所以用叙述事实的语气. 未来的事情还没有发生, 严格说来还不能确定真假, 这就是为啥未来式要在动词前加上助动词will, 因为助动词都带有不确定性.
1. He went to the U.S. last year.
2. I will go to the U.S. next year to study for an MBA degree.

##### b. 可以用公式计算出来, 可以当作事实来叙述
1. The weatherman says sunrise tomorrow is at 5:32.
2. The movie starts in 5 minutes. 同上

##### c. 主从句同时叙述两件未来的事情, 需要先假定其中一件是事实, 才能推论另外一件. 所以从句用现在式
1. I'll be ready when he comes.
2. If you are late again, you will be fired.

#### B. 条件语气(Conditional)
##### a. 句子中加上助动词, 产生不确定的语气, 称为条件语气
1. You **are** right.
  * → You **may be** right.
2. The doctor thinks it **can be** AIDS.
  * → It **could be** anything - AIDS or a common cold.

##### b. 用完成式表达对过去的猜测
```
must → should
will → would
can → could
may → might
并不代表时间上的变化, 而是表示更不确定的语气, 要用一种特别的方式来表达过去时间
```
1. It **may rain** any minute now.
  * → It **may have rained** a little last night.

#### C. 假设语气(Subjunctive)
|Time|从句|主语|
|-|-|
||要把假设条件当真, 所以不能用表示不确定性的助动词|在一个假定条件下"就会/就可能"有啥结果, 所以用过去拼法的助动词|
|<span style="color:yellow">现在时间</span>|<span style="color:yellow">现在式 → 过去式</span>|<span style="color:yellow">过去拼法的助动词 + V(动词原型)</span>|
||If I were you|I wouldn't do it|
||If I were to take the bribe|I could never look at other people in the eye again|
|<span style="color:yellow">过去时间</span>|<span style="color:yellow">过去式 → 过去完成式</span>|<span style="color:yellow">过去拼法的助动词 + have + Ven(完成)</span>|
||If I had known earlier|I might have done something|
|未来时间|过去拼法的助动词 + V(动词原型)|过去拼法的助动词 + V(动词原型)|
|未来时间接近条件语气, 表示不确定的语气|If an asteroid should hit the earth|man could die out|
||If I should take the money| could you guarantee secrecy|
|<span style="color:blue">过去 + 现在</span>|If I **had studied** harder in school|I **could qualify** for the job **now**|
|<span style="color:blue">混合真假</span>|If I had have any money with me(**false**) → only that I didn't have any money with me(**true**)|I could have contributed to the fund drive then|
|<span style="color:Fuchsia">句型变换</span>|It's time **you kid were in bed**||
||**If only I had more time!**||
||**I wish I had more time!**||

#### D. 祈使语气(Imperative)

## <a name="reduced-clauses">VII. Reduced Clauses</a>
#### A. 通用规则
